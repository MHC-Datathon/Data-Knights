# Our Question
**How can ACE violation trends inform future bus route redesigns?**

---

## Motivation
Recently, Queens buses underwent a bus route redesign. As two Queens natives, we wanted to explore how ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement) program data could have helped inform the changes made in that redesign. We hope that our analysis can contribute to future redesigns, such as the upcoming Brooklyn Bus Network Redesign (BBNR).  

The primary goal of the QBRR was to improve bus speed and frequency. ACE violation trends provide valuable insights because violations often affect both.  

For example, if a vehicle is blocking a bus stop (a mobile bus stop violation), the bus may be unable to pull in and out smoothly. This delay at one stop cascades, increasing the departure time there and lengthening arrival times at subsequent stops. By incorporating violation data, planners could better understand these friction points and design routes or infrastructure improvements that enhance overall bus reliability.

## Example 1: The Q5

For the Queens Bus Route Redesign (QBRR), the main changes to the **Q5** route were stop removals.
