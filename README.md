# Our Question
**How can ACE violation trends inform future bus route redesigns?**

---

## Motivation
Recently, Queens buses underwent a bus route redesign. As two Queens natives, we wanted to explore how ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement) program data could have helped inform the changes made in that redesign. We hope that our analysis can contribute to future redesigns, such as the upcoming Brooklyn Bus Network Redesign (BBNR).  

The primary goal of the QBRR was to improve bus speed and frequency. ACE violation trends provide valuable insights because violations often affect both.  

For example, if a vehicle is blocking a bus stop (a mobile bus stop violation), the bus may be unable to pull in and out smoothly. This delay at one stop cascades, increasing the departure time there and lengthening arrival times at subsequent stops. By incorporating violation data, planners could better understand these friction points and design routes or infrastructure improvements that enhance overall bus reliability.

## Example 1: The Q5

For the Queens Bus Route Redesign (QBRR), the main changes to the **Q5** route were stop removals.

</p>

From the pie chart, we can see a majority of the Q5’s ACE violations from before the implementation of the redesign were mobile bus stop violations, accounting for about 64% of the violations overall. On average there were about 66 violations of all types per day.

</p>

From the pie chart we can see that after the implementation of the new route, the percentage of mobile bus stop violations decreased to about 40% and on average there were about 25 violations per day. Overall, there was a 61.5% decrease in the average violations per day along the route. This trend can also be observed from the chart of violations over time. 


## Example 2: The Q58
For the QBRR(Queens bus route redesign), the main change to the Q58 was the discontinuation of the Q58 limited and the addition of the Q98 to replace it.

</p>

From the pie chart, we can see a majority of the Q58’s ACE violations from before the implementation of the redesign were mobile bus stop violations, accounting for about 51% of the violations overall. On average there were about 125 violations of all types per day.

</p>

From the pie chart we can see that after the implementation of the new route, the percentage of mobile bus lane violations increased to about 58% where as double parked violations decreased from 43% to 18%. On average there were about 11 violations per day. Overall, there was a 90.7% decrease in the average violations per day along the route. This trend can also be observed from the chart of violations over time.

The changes to the Q5 and Q58 routes show us that the frequency of ACE violations may be affected by the changes to the bus route itself. For example, in the Q5’s case several of its original stops had been removed. Some of these stops just happened to be stops where many violations occurred, which explains the decrease in mobile bus stop violations observed. This also explains why the frequency of violations per day decreased as well.

The decrease in violations to the Q58 could be due to several reasons. One possible reason is that with the introduction of the Q98, there is less congestion traffic wise later in the Q58’s route (specifically after Grand ave), as that is where the Q98’s route differs from the Q58’s route. The other potential reason will be discussed in the limitations section. 

Overall, we recommend that for future bus route redesigns, stops that have more recorded ACE violations be considered for removal. Specifically, if the stop with more ACE violations is one that is not in a frequently trafficked area, or one that is reasonably close to other stops, then it should be removed to improve the overall speed of the buses.
